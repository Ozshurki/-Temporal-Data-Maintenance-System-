A temporal data maintenance system developed with:

Python,
PostgreSQL,
psycopg2 library for communicate with the database

Notes:

I imported the patients csv file and the mapping loinc number to lcn csv file with Pgadmin to PostgreSQL.

I created a database for modified records and track the updated records.

At the first run I add the columns modified_date and deleted_date
